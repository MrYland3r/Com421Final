        <p>Here you will find the best tips and tricks to fight your traffic tickets and win!</p>
        <p>First, you need to know what you're up against. The traffic court system is a complex and confusing system. It is designed to be that way. The more confusing it is, the more likely you are to give up and pay the ticket. Don't let that happen to you!</p> 
        <p>Here are some of the most common traffic tickets and how to fight them:</p>

        <h2>A Step by Step Guide</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First of all, act quickly. You have 7 days from the issues of a parking/complience voliolation to contest the ticket. If you do not contest your ticket within that time, you have another 21 days to request a hearing. If no response is reccived in those 21 days, a Notice of Determination is issued. You have another 21 days to contenst the ticket, afterwhich, you forefit your right to challenge.</li>
            <li>Some tickets will automatically reccive a hearing date and time, which will be printed on your ticket. If it does not, follow the instructions on your ticket to request one</li>
            <li>Get your evedince together. For each violation there are many factors which can lead to a dismisal of your traffic ticket, like an inoperable meter for a parking ticket, or inconsisent facts for a speeding violation<a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/fin/supp_info/revenue/challenging_tickets/contesting_in_person.html">(Here is a list of allowed defenses).</a> Err on the side of too much evedince rather than too little. A photo that shows only part of the block probably will not convince the judge that there are no signs on the entire block. Witnesses aare also a good resource to bring</li>
            <li>On the day of the hearing, ensure a few things:
                <ul>
                <li>Wear formal/nice clothing. This lends you more credibility and trustworthyness</li>
                <li>Arrive early. This will give you time to get your bearings and prepare for the hearing</li>
                <li>Bring your evedince. This is the most important thing. If you do not have your evedince, you will not be able to prove your case</li>
                <li>Bring a witness if you have one. This will help strengthen your case</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The city will present its side of the case first, brining evedince gathered agaisnt you. In many cases, the hearing officer dismisses the violation at this point, if they belive there is not enough evedince.</li>
            <li>If needed, present your evedince and tell the hearing officer your side of the story. Ensure to follow court etiqeutte closely at this point, making sure not to talk over the officer, answering questions honestly and respectifully.</li>
            <li>If you lose your hearing, you have 35 days to appeal to the circuit court, during which you can only presnet the evedince you have used during this trial.</li>
        </ol>
